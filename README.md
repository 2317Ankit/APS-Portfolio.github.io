- Competitive Edge: Superior search functionality can differentiate Flipkart from competitors.

**Approach**
- Create an inverted index where each filter attribute (e.g., brand, price range) points to a bitmap.
- Each bitmap represents whether a product satisfies a particular filter criterion (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- For each product, generate a bit representation for each filter category.
- Store these representations in an inverted index.
- Retrieve the bitmaps for each filter applied by the user.
- Perform bitwise AND operations on the retrieved bitmaps.

**Time Complexity**
- Preprocessing: O(N * M) where N is the number of products and M is the number of filter categories.
- Filtering: O(F) where F is the number of filters applied. This is because bitwise operations on bitmaps are linear in the number of products, but very fast due to hardware-level operations.

**Space Complexity**
- Inverted Index: O(N * M) where N is the number of products and M is the number of filter categories.
- Bitmaps: Each filter criterion requires a bitmap of size N (number of products), leading to a space complexity of O(N * M).
